# Unemployment_Analysis_with_python

This project focuses on analyzing the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the job market in India. By utilizing data analysis techniques and Python programming, we delve into a comprehensive dataset to gain insights into the unemployment trends across different regions and states. The project aims to provide a deeper understanding of the socio-economic effects of the pandemic and aid in the formulation of targeted strategies to address unemployment challenges in specific regions.

## Dataset

The analysis is based on a dataset obtained from Kaggle, which includes information on states, dates, unemployment rates, employment numbers, and labor participation rates. The dataset enables us to evaluate the impact of the pandemic on employment and identify the states that have been most affected, taking into account their respective regions.

## Project Overview

- Utilized a comprehensive dataset from Kaggle, containing information such as states, dates, frequency of measurement, estimated unemployment rate, estimated employed individuals, estimated labor participation rate, and region classification.
- Conducted data preprocessing to ensure data quality and consistency.
- Performed exploratory data analysis to gain insights into unemployment trends across different regions and states in India.
- Utilized various data visualization techniques, including bar plots, box plots, sunburst plots, and scatter plots, to visualize and communicate the findings effectively.
- Analyzed the impact of the lockdown on unemployment rates before and after the enforcement of restrictions.
- Calculated the percentage change in unemployment rates to understand the magnitude of the impact.

## Key Findings

- April and May showed the highest unemployment rates across states such as Puducherry, Tamil Nadu, Jharkhand, Bihar, and Haryana.
- Northern states, southern states, and eastern states experienced the highest unemployment rates during April and May.
- The analysis revealed that the lockdown had the most significant impact on Puducherry, while Meghalaya was least affected.
- North India exhibited the highest overall unemployment rate, followed by South India, East India, Northwest India, and West India.
